# ArtixDuo
A Dual Artix-7 FPGA board intended for developing Chip-Chip interface busses and advanced FPGA projects

This board is currently on Rev 2. As testing and bringup continue, more changes may be made. Original Altium Files have been provided along with a PDF schematic file. Vivado XDC files and SMC firmware will be added. 

Two XDC files are needed, one for FPGA1 and one for FPGA0. They cannot be interchanged!
